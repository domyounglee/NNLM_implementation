# NNLM_implementation

## Reproducing NNLM 
I Reproduce the Neural Network Language Model from the paper " A Neural Probabilistic Language Model "



I Checked out the performance by compare the result of the paper 'How to generate a Good Word Embedding'
My result is quite similar to the result of this paper' NNLM model 



It was written in C 
NNLM_ada_v1.c       -> final version of my implementation
NNLM_ada_v1_old.c   -> previous version of my first implementation 
NNLM_ada_v1_acc.c   -> accelerated version from NNLM_ada_v1.c 

nnlm.c  -> author's code from the paper 'How to Generate a Good Word Embedding?'
